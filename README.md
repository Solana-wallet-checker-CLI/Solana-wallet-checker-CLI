# Solana Wallet Checker CLI: Powerful Command-Line Tool for SOL Management

**SolanaChecker** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built for interacting with the Solana blockchain. This provides users with a flexible, powerful way to manage their wallets, check balances, analyze transactions, and more. The CLI design makes it ideal for automation, scripting, and efficient interaction with the Solana network.

## Setting Up Telegram (for Real-Time Notifications)

To receive notifications in Telegram, configure your bot token and chat ID. Add these to the 'telegram-settings.txt' file within the project folder. This is helpful for automated monitoring of events.

## Getting Started: Download or Build

Download a pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself.

## Building the Project (CLI Focused)

Building the project provides the best way to control the build process, dependencies and ensure your copy is safe.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  If you donâ€™t have **vcpkg** yet, clone the repository and install it by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

2.  After installing **vcpkg**, add it to your system PATH environment variable.

3.  Run the following commands:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  Build the project.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure that **vcpkg** is integrated correctly with your environment.
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure that all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg** and accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile the project using the command (example):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line - Your Gateway to Solana Control

Utilize the command line interface to execute functions.

1.  **-s / -search**: Start the brute-force seed phrase generation.
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Start tracking the specified address.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate the specified number of Solana wallets.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Display wallet information using the seed phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: *Check the Solana balance of the specified address. This command is central to the CLI usage.*
